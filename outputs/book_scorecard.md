# Book-wide validation scorecard (Thread 4)

Every covered name on ONE consistent, validated machine. **The product is the *boundary of what's comparable*, not a buy list.** `pending` ≠ `passed`: a name with a registered-pending gate is shown pending, never blessed. NAV age-0 basis is the uniform **xclusiv Resale** line (2026-06-22); mid-age is transaction-anchored (§9.9).

**Gates per name:** (1) NAV-basis (resale-uniform ⇒ comparable; else flagged); (2) Justified P/NAV both bases (§17); (3) parity band (§A1.2); (4) §18.5a mean-reversion (Thread 3, data-pending); (5) §18.5b orderbook cross-check (Thread 5, data-pending); (6) robust vs flips (does the read survive the parity↔historical choice).

**Confidence tier (governance handoff):** the FV's reliability for a sizing decision, read from the validation state above — **VALIDATED-TIGHT** (traced basis + robust across both §17 bases — broker OR internal two-basis corroboration; SB-class), **GOVERNED-WIDE** (NAV traces but rests on a structural-unavailable input or a read that flips — usable directional anchor, wide band; CMBT-class), **PROVISIONAL** (a NAV-driving figure is uncited / off-basis — **NOT handoff-ready, flag don't pass**; NAT-class). APPROX-pnav does not demote a robust name; an immaterial uncited operating-scrubber surface does not either (see provenance.py).

## Summary

**NAV-basis (comparability boundary):** pending-sourceable 4, resale-uniform 11, structural-unavailable 6, unverified-no-current-xclusiv-line 1.

**Read robustness (parity↔historical):** flips 2, n/a 13, robust 7.

**Confidence tier (handoff):** GOVERNED-WIDE 10, PROVISIONAL 7, VALIDATED-TIGHT 5.

**⛔ NOT handoff-ready (PROVISIONAL — do NOT pass a governed FV):** ASC, BRUT, ECO, HAFN, NAT, STNG, TRMD. Each carries a NAV-driving figure that is uncited or off-basis (figure-provenance / off-convention queue); flag, don't pass, until it traces.

**Both §18.5 gates are registered-PENDING book-wide** — no Baltic $/day series (§18.5a) or orderbook ratios (§18.5b) in-repo; see `backtest/DATA_CONTRACT_NORMAL_RATES.md`. So no name is *fully* validated yet; the resale-uniform names are comparable and parity-banded, awaiting only the two data-gated gates.

**Caveat — crude `rich` is cycle position, not a short.** Crude pure-plays read rich because the §17 RONAV is through-cycle while price embeds the near-peak NTM rate (§12 NAT mechanism); read the crude reads with cycle position, not as TRIM/SHORT calls.

**§15 governance dual-read:** CMDB (30%), TEN (30%) carry a realisation haircut applied downstream (blend + strip terminal), NOT in the clean-NAV reads above — their reads are clean-basis; the haircut basis scales NAV/FV by (1 − haircut).
